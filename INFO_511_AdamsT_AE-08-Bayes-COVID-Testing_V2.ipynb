    "Discussion Questions:\n",
    "1. Is this Calculation Surprising? Considering the sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, is the \n",
    "    high probability of having the disease given a positive test result unexpected? Why or why not?  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The concerns are Type 1 vs. Type 2 errors. Given the high specificity of the test,  \n",
    "    false positives (type 1) should be low and the tests are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the explanation? Explain why the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is so high. \n",
    "    Consider the impact of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Posterior probability is the later outcome, given new information. The high specificity but moderate sensitivity  \n",
    "    suggests that this test rules out type 2 errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Was this calculation actually reasonable to perform? Discuss whether it is reasonable to calculate the probability  \n",
    "     of having the disease based on the given data. Are there any limitations or assumptions in this calculation?\n",
    "\n",
    "     It's difficult to say whether this is reasonable. More would need to be known about the data source and collection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  What if we tested in a different population, such as high-risk individuals? How might the probability of having the disease  \n",
    "    given a positive test result change if the test was administered to a population with a higher prevalence of COVID-19?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The higher the prevalence, the higher the posterior prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  What if we were to test a random individual in a county where the prevalence of COVID-19 is approximately 25%?  \n",
    "    Recalculate the probability of having the disease given a positive test result for a population with a 25% prevalence of COVID-19.  \n",
    "    How does this compare to the original calculation?\n",
